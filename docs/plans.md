# Ness Fam Survivor Board Future

At a high level, I want to keep a website up for the teams drafted by the Ness fam moving forward in the Survivor Draft.

## Views
1. Full Draft Board
- This should be the whole damn board including alternates. I want to see a true draft board style view with contestants listed under the teams.

2. Tribe
- I also want to be able to see who is available based on what tribe they are in.

3. Player Profile View
- It could be nice to have a player view that displays tribe, team drafted to, etc.

4. Editing Players
- For each property they have, there should be a box to put a value

## Storage!
I want this to be stored in graph somehow. I think it would be a good opportunity to represent the necessary data while also deepening that bag of mine. 


# Things to See
- How many votes they have
- Team they are on - player profile
- Close allies
- Times gone to tribal
- Whether or not they have an idol/advantage
- Strengths/weaknesses
- Player ranking system - very baseline 
- The ability to follow the show without having done a draft (use case: outside family that likes to watch)
